# Programming 1: Personal Programming Practice 8

---

Write functions to tackle the following problems in the given .py files. Helper code for inputing a tuple or dictionary from the user and outputting results has been provided. You may discuss and collaborate with your peers, but you should submit your own code and fully understand all code you submit. If you work with others on one of the parts, cite your collaborators in a comment near the top of that file.

1. In **same_tuple.py**, write a function called isConstant that takes one parameter, a tuple, and return True if every element of the tuple is the same, False otherwise.
2. In **dictionary.py**, write two functions called maxVal and minVal that each take 1 parameter, a dictionary, and return the key corresponding to the maximum / minimum value, respectively, in the dictionary.

*You only have to complete the function definitions at the top of the files -- you may leave the input and output portions untouched! But you are welcome to explore and mess with the other code I provided as time allows.*
